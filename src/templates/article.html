    <article >It has been an impressive effort by our charismatic leader, Narendra Modi and the Government of India to make our country a clean and hygienic place as described when he spoke of his vision of #SwachhBharat in the Independence Day address to the nation and again at Madison Square Garden in the USA. I never imagined it being adopted so quickly by the officials and the citizens of my country but when Narendra Modi returned to India he brought with him the most crucial project a government can ever attempt in a country like India where its large population is one of the biggest strongholds as well as an enormous weakness. But it is important to remember what our current Prime-Minister said about #SwachhBharat not being a project of the government but a project of the people. We would do well to note that its success depends on how seriously we, the citizens of India take it. According to reports, this campaign aims to accomplish the vision of 'clean India' by 2nd October 2019, 150th birthday of Mahatma Gandhi and is expected to cost over Rs 62,000 crore. The campaign was described as "beyond politics" and "inspired by patriotism" by our prime-minister Narendra Modi. More than 3 million government employees and schools and colleges students of India have participated in this event along with millions of citizens.

The sincerity of the governments efforts was shown through the circular and e-mail we received from the Institute stating the formal launch of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan from October 2, 2014 on the occasion of Gandhi Jayanti and how it has been taken up by our college authorities and students with the same enthusiasm. I always feel proud when I hear guests visiting our campus say, "NITK is one of the most clean and verdant campus' across the country" . This is definitely a collective effort of all the residents of the campus. But there is always scope for improvement and I am sure we will be able to set up a new standard of cleanliness in our campus.

I wanted to suggest the idea of a clean and pollution free Diwali this year in our campus without the use of any crackers. All the efforts of lesser environmental pollution and cleanliness are put on hold and forgotten during Diwali when we spend lakhs of rupees literally on fire for listening to some loud noise and generating a great amount of smoke. This causes huge amounts of air pollution, the effects of which remain there for the next few days showcased by the dirt created by the crackers that is rarely cleaned up. The scale of the pollution that occurs on that day is something we are all aware of and can control. The need for the sound of crackers can easily be subsititued by the arrangement of large speakers and a DJ too for celebration.

Our campus is a home for qualified professors and highly talented students from across the country with a literacy of a hundred percent. I feel like it is safe to assume that everybody here understands the impact of pollution and the cons of using crackers that I do not have to state in order to prove. Every one of us can play our part in having a clean, green environment and by celebrating a Diwali without crackers and smoke. A friend of mine once said that the ''Festivals are best occasions to share and spend a quality time with friends and family''. Hopefully this festive season brings all the happiness and love that we wish for - for ourselves and our surroundings. 
I wish you all a Happy Diwali and a great Festive Season!
